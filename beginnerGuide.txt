# Beginner Guide: Setting Up the Facial Recognition and Music Recommendation Project

## 1. Install Python

- Download and install **Python 3.8 - 3.10** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- During installation, **check "Add Python to PATH"**.

## 2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

- On Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
- On Mac/Linux: Open your Terminal app.

## 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PawanTheGod/Facial-recognition-and-music-recommendation.git
cd Facial-recognition-and-music-recommendation
```

## 4. (Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment:
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 5. Upgrade pip

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## 6. Install All Required Libraries

```bash
pip install flask opencv-python tensorflow keras spotipy pandas
```

## 7. Download the FER2013 Dataset

- Go to [Kaggle FER2013](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013).
- Download the dataset and place it in the project folder as needed for training.

## 8. Set Up Spotify Credentials

- Sign up for a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
- Create an app, then copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
- Open `Spotipy.py` and enter your credentials where required.

## 9. (Optional) If You Want to Train the Model

```bash
python train.py
```
- This will train the emotion recognition model (can take several hours!).

## 10. Run the Flask Application

```bash
python app.py
```
- Grant camera permission if prompted.
- Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the app.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an error about missing packages, re-run the install command in step 6.
- If you have issues with OpenCV and camera, ensure your webcam is working and permissions are granted.
- For Tensorflow errors, make sure you use Python 3.8-3.10. Newer Python versions may cause issues.
- For Spotify errors, double-check your credentials and internet connection.

## All Major Dependencies (with compatible versions):

- **Python**: 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10
- **Flask**: 2.x
- **opencv-python**: 4.x
- **Tensorflow**: 2.x
- **Keras**: 2.x (bundled with Tensorflow)
- **Spotipy**: latest
- **Pandas**: 1.x or newer

This guide ensures you avoid version conflicts and can run the project smoothly as a beginner!
